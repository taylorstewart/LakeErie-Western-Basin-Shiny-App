# Lake Erie Fish Community Data Explorer
A shiny application summarizing trawl catch data in the western basin of Lake Erie from 2013-2015, Spring and Autumn, collected by the U.S. Geological Survey, Great Lakes Science Center, Lake Erie Biological Station.

## Purpose
This data is intended for use by Lake Erie fisheries managers, academia, the fishing industry, and the public. The data sets are annually evaluated to provide estimates of abundance of key forage and predator species, to assess seasonal and spatial distributions of fishes, and assess year class strength of key forage and predator species in the western basin of Lake Erie. The data sets are then presented in an interactive, online format in which this metadata supports. Details about the vessel and gear descriptions, sampling protocols, and catch processing protocols can be found in the methods section of this metadata. The data will automatically update as surveys are completed in future years.
